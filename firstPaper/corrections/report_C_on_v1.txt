The paper under review establishes yet another interesting connection in between
the representation theory of associative algebras and combinatorics. Namely the
main result presented is an interpretation of the support $\tau$-tilting complex
of any gentle algebra $kQ/I$ as the non-kissing complex of an associated
``blossoming'' quiver. Leveraging this correspondence the authors then prove
several regularity properties of these complexes including congruence-uniformity
of the corresponding lattices and polytopality, in the finite case, of the
realizing simplicial fan. 

This papers sits in a currently very active area of research as exemplified by
the many connections presented through the exposition. In particular related
results were recently obtained independently by Brüstle, Douville, Mousavand,
Thomas, Yıldırım and  Demonet, Iyama, Reading, Reiten, Thomas. A special mention
goes to the work of McConville and Garver, McConville: many of the proofs in
sections 2 and 3 are heavily inspired by their results which are special cases
of those presented here.

In view of the quality of the exposition and of the quite interesting results in
this manuscript I would advice Memoirs of the AMS to accept it for publication.

Here is a list of minor nitpicks the authors could improve on:

* In the introduction, and in the introductory paragraphs of several sections
  the authors are sometimes quite abrupt and discuss notions that have not been
  introduced yet. For example examples this happens in
  - page 1, line 2: non-kissing paths
  - page 43: $\mathcal{L}_{nk}(\overline{Q})$
  Could this notions be introduces, at least vaguely, before using them?

* page 1 paragraph 1: ``The interest in'' rather then ``The interest for''

* page 2 par 3: ``description of flips''

* par: 3 ``remarquable'' is French

* page 3: the footnotes refer to the table on next page; they are quite
  confusing here.

* page 6, last line: while the meaning of $I^{rev}$ is clear this has not been
  introduced formally.

* Figure 1: all other figures in the paper are not separated into sub figures by
  lines as this one is

* Def 1.12: say ``The algebra ... associated to a gentle bound quiver is called''
  or something similar.

* page 15 above 1.1.7: all of a sudden there is a shorthand for band modules
  that was not introduced 

* page 15 bottom: this formula looks quite ugly, can you remove the text from
  it by defining the two sets first? Even better can you replace the formula 
  with a sentence?

* page 17: the name ``dance'' suggests a symmetric notion but it is not. If
  there in no better name available it should at least be stated clearly that
  this is not a symmetric notion.

* page 24 intro: ``the operation of flip''

* Example 2.2 and many more occurrences: Through the paper there is a recurring
  example and the authors decided to name it by $Q_{exm}$ et similia.
  This makes it look like it is some sort of notation when it is not. I would
  suggest to remove this convention and to just refer to it as the recurring
  example or the example in figure 15.

* Just below: ``See Figure 15'' is not needed here

* bottom of page 24 what is a non-kissing cycle? Do you mean not self-kissing?

* Figure 17: $Q_{pa}$ as above why is an example given a notation-like name?

* Figure 18: crossing walks have not been introduced

* remark 2.20: the first bullet point ``should'' should the ``then'' you are
  stating a fact not an hope

* proof of 2.21: ``follow'' is not really clear here

* def 2.36: is any flip either increasing or decreasing?

* def 3.4: do you mean ``any strict subset''?

* def 3.16 and others: $\mathcal{S}$ and $S$ are not easily distinguishable 

* Proof of theorem 3.20: the numberings do not correspond to each other

* page 49 previous to last paragraph: ``ordered by:'' should be ``ordered by''

* Example 3.36: Figure 34 does not illustrate $\omega$

* Example 3.44: It appears to me that the map, which is not explicit, is on the
  quotient of $Bic$

* pages 59,60,64,65,68,73 and probably more: the text goes outside the margin

* remark 3.72: do you mean ``Figure 36 (bottom)''?

A note about notation. This article uses a quite creative notation set. For
example the blossoming quiver has a little flower as exponent and the operation
of blinding is represented by two half circle to suggest blinkers. I am not sure
I am happy about these choices but I do not have better suggestions to offer.
