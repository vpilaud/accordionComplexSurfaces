Dear Editors, dear Referee,

We would like to thank you for your careful consideration of our manuscript on "Associahedra for finite type cluster algebras and minimal relations between g-vectors". 

We have revised our submission according to the referee's comments. More specifically, we made the following changes:
	* p.3: We updated our references to BMDM+18, BM21 and AHHL21 concerning the level generality of these papers.
	* p.10 and p.14: We modified Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 to be more precise on which section of the type cone we are considering.
	* p.9: We said more explicitly in Proposition 1.1 that h is indexed by the rays of the fan.
	* p.16: We have been more explicit on the essentialization of the g-vector fan.
	* p.31: We explained why sigma = tau when sigma and tau are not disjoint.
	* p.36: We added the reference YZ19 after Definition 3.5.
	* p.37: We added a proof to Corollary 3.13.
	* p.48. We explained why t = t' at the end of the proof or Lemma 4.33.

We thank again the referee for these comments, and would like to submit this revised version for further consideration for publication in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society

Best regards,
Arnau Padrol, Yann Palu, Vincent Pilaud, and Pierre-Guy Plamondon
